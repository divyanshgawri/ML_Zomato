This project represents a comprehensive approach to enhancing the restaurant selection process through advanced data processing, predictive modeling, and visualization techniques. At its core, the project aims to optimize user satisfaction by providing tailored restaurant recommendations and accurate rating predictions.

Beginning with data cleaning and preprocessing, the project ensures that the restaurant data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. This step involves handling missing values, standardizing formats, and encoding categorical variables to facilitate seamless integration into machine learning models.

The predictive modeling aspect leverages sophisticated algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Linear Regression. SVMs are employed for classification tasks, enabling the system to categorize restaurants based on various factors like average cost, price range, and customer reviews (ratings). Meanwhile, Linear Regression predicts numerical outcomes such as aggregate ratings, using features like average cost, price range, and customer votes.

To enhance user experience, the system employs visualization techniques to present recommendations in an intuitive manner. This includes graphical displays that highlight recommended restaurants based on individual preferences and predicted ratings. By visualizing these recommendations, users can quickly assess their options and make informed decisions about dining choices.

Overall, the project aims to streamline the restaurant selection process by integrating data-driven insights and predictive capabilities. By offering personalized suggestions and accurate rating predictions, it seeks to empower users with the information needed to choose restaurants that best align with their preferences and expectations. Through these efforts, the project ultimately aims to improve user satisfaction and simplify the decision-making process when selecting dining venues.
